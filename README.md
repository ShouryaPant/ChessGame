# Chess Game MADE BY ME AND TEJAS DWIVEDI[<a>href="https://github.com/tejasd07"</a>]

We made a GUI BASED Chess game using Python and Pygame. We used certain algorithms to make it completely functional. So when the user clicks the Executable file , a new GUI WINDOW will open asking the user with two options . Play the game or QUIT . When user clicks the PLAY GAME BUTTON Then the game will start and white has to start the game. The game follows and continues as per the CHESS RULES. At the end winner is declared by either CHECKMATE OR STALEMATE and a message will be Prompted on the screen to whoever wins the game-- "BLACK OR WHITE".

## SOME SPECIAL FEATURES WE PROVIDED IN THE GAME

# CHECKMATE 

When the player is left with no move in the board to protect his king and the king is surrounded by all the opponent pieces . The player loses it by CHECKMATE

# STALEMATE

When the player is left with no pieces and only his KING IS LEFT so after 30 moves the player loses by STALEMATE.

# CASTLING

When the positions between the king or rook are empty , user gets an option to do the castling that is to give his king extra protection by doing this move in which the positions of the ROOK AND KING ARE SWAPPED.

# EN PASSANT

When the pawn moves the very first chance with two squares and it gets surrounded by opponent pawns then it gives the pawn a special move to move DIAGONALLY AND CAPTURE THE OPPONENT PAWNS.

# PAWN PROMOTIONS

When the pawn of the user reaches the end of the 8x8 grid he can promot his pawn to queen and can get an extra QUEEN.

# ANIMATION 

We provided amazing animations and Highlighting square option which gives an ultimate UI  and animations to the player which makes our game so much special. Also when the user clicks a piece on his chance then he will get highlighted squares which will tell him all the possible moves in which he can move his piece.
